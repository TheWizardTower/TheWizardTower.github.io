# Hams

On November 20th, I took and passed all three ham radio tests, and got my Amateur Extra license. Thing is, I was on a _very_ tight budget. Nevertheless, I managed to find a number of resources that were able to make this process an enjoyable one.

## But, why?

Ham Radio is an odd hobby. I got into it because I was studying electrical physics and circuit analysis in college, and I had a friend at the local cigar shop that was active in the hobby.

My college experience was not a spectacular one, and my professional career went in mostly a different direction, so the opportunity to put some of the skills I picked up in circuits classes to use was an appealing one. Beyond that, however, a few other points drew me to it.

* It's tremendously useful for disaster recovery.
  -  When things go sideways, phone, internet, and cell infrastructure is regularly either overloaded or rendered completely non-functional. Hams are frequently coordinating with emergency response organizations. There are even organizations built around this idea (RACES and ARES).
  - It's also a useful thing to have in places where cell service is spotty to non-existent. :)
* It's decentralized.
  - There's a lot of kerfuffle around access to the commons on the internet. How access to a platform like Twitter or Patreon should be controlled or regulated is a *very* hot topic right now. I think it's going to get a lot worse before it gets better. Ham radio is intrinsically decentralized. Making a contact involves two people with antennas that can throw watts onto a wire and catch them out of the air. That's it. Free speech is kind of built into the medium.
  - This also means that if you can have some very honest conversations with people abroad about what's _actually_ going on in their corner of the world.
* It supports some sophisticated below-noise-floor communication methods.
  - [Olivia](http://www.oliviamode.com/), for example.
  - The above point about honest conversations? This helps that a lot.
* You can meet people you wouldn't have crossed paths with otherwise
* It's a great way to learn more about electronics and radio theory.

If you're sold, keep reading!

## Preparation.

Briefly, here's the process:

* Look up an [exam in your area](http://www.arrl.org/find-an-amateur-radio-license-exam-session).
  - Give yourself about a month to study. Contact the VEs, let them know you're planning on attending.
* Start studying for your test(s).
* Get a [TI-36x Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Texas-Instruments-Engineering-Scientific-Calculator/dp/B004NBZB2Y/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=ti-36x+pro&qid=1576051640&sr=8-1).
  - Obviously, this is just a suggestion, but it has a few things to recommend it.
  - One, it can convert between rectangular and polar coordinates automatically. This comes in handy on the Amateur Extra test.
  - Two, it isn't a full-fledged graphing calculator, which aren't allowed for test use.
    - (I know, it stinks, I still had my TI-86+ from college...)
  - That being said, double check with the VEs running your exam session to make sure they're okay with this calculator. I've heard horror stories of people only allowing four-function calculators...
* Optional: Get your FCC FRN
  - You don't need this, but this will save you from writing your SSN on the 605 form at the test.
  - Go [here](https://apps.fcc.gov/coresWeb/publicHome.do) and register.
* Review the material, read a lot, take many tests.
  - I _strongly_ recommend [HamStudy.org](https://hamstudy.org). The website is free, [the app](https://hamstudy.org/appstore) is about $4 for offline on-the-go study.
  - Many have gotten value from [Dave Casler](https://www.youtube.com/user/davecasler/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=3)'s channel. I didn't have the funds to buy the ARRL handbooks, and I found his videos too tied them to be of use without it.
  - [W4EEY](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI3DKjqB4OLY2UXm2KqDpwQ/playlists)'s channel, on the other hand, was tremendously useful as a stand-alone resource.
  - [K6BNU](https://www.kb6nu.com/study-guides/) has study guides available. The PDF of the Technician's guide is available for free.
* Go to the exam, take the test(s), and pass!
  - Take a few blank sheets of note paper, three pencils, your FRN (if you got it), and your calculator.
  
## In-Depth
  
I mentioned that I studied circuit analysis. That meant that I had at least some familiarity with the electrical principles on all three tests, which obviously helped quite a lot. I'd also studied up to Calc III, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations, so obviously the math part of the test wasn't going to pose a significant obstacle.
  
However, there's still quite a lot of material on the test that is either rote memorization (frequency allocation and power limits were the biggest gotchas here), or just "general knowledge" that has accreted over the century and change ham radio has been around, or thing that wouldn't have come up in a traditional college Circuits I or II course.
  
The advice I got from my Elmer (Ham Mentor) was essentially to take practice tests until I was scoring 85-90%, then take my Technician's test. "Don't overthink it."
  
Well, I never really got to the point to where I was hitting that mark consistently, in no small part due to the fact that I was trying to memorize a pile of facts that I had no other connection to.

This is where [HamStudy.org](https://hamstudy.org) comes into play. Unlike other practice test resources, this provides an explanation of the question, rather than the usual "it was D" answer one comes to expect from other test sites.

These explanations will regularly go into a full explanation of the mathematical calculation needed, and/or cite both Wikipedia and YouTube sources for further background. This was *tremendously* valuable to me. I don't think I could have passed if I didn't have this. I certainly would not have gotten all the way to Amateur Extra.

[W4EEY](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI3DKjqB4OLY2UXm2KqDpwQ/playlists)'s channel was also invaluable, for a variety of reasons. First, it provided more context about the material I was studying, which I found very valuable. Second, the classes are available as mp3 downloads, which meant I could listen on the go, while shopping or driving. This isn't always ideal -- the material is made with the intent of being seen, as well as heard, so you'll sometimes be subjected to the usual "As you can see..." trap. But, even so, it's useful.

[W4AEW](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL535F3913B822E098) has a great youtube channel with a lot of very well-explained ham radio material. One of the answers in HamStudy.org pointed me to his channel, and his stuff has explained a lot of things that were very tricky.

All this is great, but there's one thing I never quite saw the pattern behind, and that's frequency allocations. With these questions, I largely had to just guess. I discovered that if a question was asking something like "What frequency is on the 15M band?", it was never the one that was exactly on it (300 / 15M = 20MHz), but very close to it.

The best resource I found for this was just staring at the [frequency allocation chart](http://www.arrl.org/graphical-frequency-allocations) the ARRL provides. Obviously the best case here is to have it hanging in your ham shack, but if you don't have the means for that right off, the PDF is pretty browsable. :)

Finally, [Pocket RxTx](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ro.yo3ggx.rxtx&hl=en_US) was very useful in "getting my feet wet" as I was studying. You can't transmit with this app (and you can't transmit before you get your license anyway), but you can hop on a WebSDR and scroll around the bands and listen for conversations. It was quite motivating to me to be able to scroll around, stumble across AM stations, and catch people having voice conversations on SSB across the world. It's a zero-cost way to start putting the material you're studying to use.

## Other things to consider.

The local library here in Republic, WA, is _staggeringly_ good. It's electronic library is the most extensive and well supported I've ever seen. Aside from this, one thing they also do is take purchase requests. Since I didn't have the spare cash to buy the ARRL manuals, I submitted the Tech, General, and Amateur Extra books as suggestions. All three were accepted -- but, the Tech and General books arrived the day _after_ my test, and the AE one has yet to come in.

That being said, if you're on a budget, talk to your local library and see if they have a similar program.

I need to find a good circuits class to add to this list. It's a significant part of the material on the three tests, and it was an equally significant part of why I passed the tests. My college classes were generally unimpressive, so I'll have to find a lecture series that explains things well.

## After Exam Day

The good news is, you'll know your results right away. The bad news is, if you're starting from nothing, you won't be able to use your hard-won privileges until your callsign appears in the FCC's [Universal License System](https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/searchLicense.jsp).

Finding yourself in this can be a bit of a trick. If you got your FRN, you can search by that and see if the paperwork has been processed. If you didn't, you'll have to search by your name. This is in a very particular format of:

```
LastName Suffix, FirstName MI
```

[FAQ entry on this topic](https://wireless2.fcc.gov/helpfiles/licenseSearch/helpBasic.html#name).

It gets even more complicated if you have a capitalized repeated letter in a name. Ask Me, Adam McCullough, how I know...

Alternatively, you can also search for changes made around a geographic region within a certain period of time [here](https://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/searchAdvanced.jsp). You can narrow the geographic component down to the address you gave on exam day.

Moral of the story: Get your FRN. :)

## Now what?

Now, you get a radio and start making contacts! If you didn't pass all three, keep studying for the other test(s) you have left. If you did pass everything, consider becoming a Volunteer Examiner!
